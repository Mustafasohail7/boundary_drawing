# Inner Boundary Drawing

This algorithm was written as an assignment for the course CS-446 in Habib University. This assingment is supposed to replicate the bwboundaries function of MATLAB.

- The code uses radial sweep algorithm [1] to draw an inner boundary for a primitive shape provided as input.
- Sample inputs are included in the repository.
- The code is written in MATLAB.
- 'boundary.m' contains the main function while 'main.m' contains the driver code
